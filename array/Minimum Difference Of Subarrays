Problem statement
You are given an array 'ARR' that consists of ‘N’ numbers. Your task is to split the array into two non-empty subarrays such that the absolute difference between their sum is minimum. For example,
If the given array is [6,7,1,8,5]. We can split the array into [6,7,1] and [8,5].
Hence the answer will be |14-13| = 1 which is minimum.

Code:
int minimumDifference(int n, vector<int> arr)
{
    int total=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        total+=arr[i];
    }
    int mindiff=INT_MAX;
    int j=0;
    int sum=0;
    while(j<arr.size()){
    sum+=arr[j];
    int val=total-sum;
    mindiff=min(mindiff,abs(sum-val));
    j++;
    }
    return mindiff;
}
