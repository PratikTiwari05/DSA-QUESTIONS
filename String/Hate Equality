Problem statement
There are two strings 'S' and 'T', each having 'N' lowercase English characters. Initially, both strings are equal.



You don't want the string 'T' equal to 'S'. For this, you can reshuffle the characters of the string 'T'.



Determine if you can make the string 'T' different from 'S' after reshuffling the characters of the string 'T'.



Return '1' if you can make the string 'T' different from 'S'. Otherwise, return '0'.



Example:
N = 7
S = 'aab'
Initially, the string 'T' is equal to 'aab'.
You can shuffle the characters such that 'T' equals 'aba'. So 'T' is not equal to 'S'.
So, the answer for this case is '1'.




code:
int canYouMakeDifference(int n, string &s) {
    // Write your code here.
    unordered_set<char>st;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        st.insert(s[i]);
    }
    if(st.size()<=1){
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
